- **User Dashboard:** View a list of users with options to edit or delete.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Protected Routes:** Ensures that only authenticated users can access certain pages.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux:** State management library for predictable state updates.
- **React Router:** Declarative routing for React applications.
- **Material-UI:** React components for faster and easier web development.
- **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
